            "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nThe problem states that Camila writes down five positive integers, and we need to find the least possible value for the mode given certain conditions about the mode, median, and arithmetic mean of these integers.\n\n## Step 2: Define the terms and conditions\nLet's denote the five integers as $a, b, c, d, e$ in ascending order. The mode is the number that appears most frequently, the median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in ascending order (which is $c$ in this case), and the arithmetic mean is the average of the numbers.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the given conditions\nThe unique mode is $2$ greater than the median, so $mode = c + 2$. The median is $2$ greater than the arithmetic mean, so $c = \\frac{a + b + c + d + e}{5} + 2$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the mode and median relationship\nSince $c$ is the median and the mode is $c + 2$, and given that the mode is unique, the mode must occur at least twice. For the mode to be $c + 2$, $d$ and $e$ must be equal to $c + 2$ because they are greater than or equal to $c$. So, $d = e = c + 2$.\n\n## Step 5: Express the condition for the median and the arithmetic mean\nGiven $d = e = c + 2$, the numbers are $a, b, c, c+2, c+2$. The median is $c$, and the arithmetic mean is $\\frac{a + b + c + (c + 2) + (c + 2)}{5} = \\frac{a + b + 3c + 4}{5}$. The condition $c = \\frac{a + b + 3c + 4}{5} + 2$ can be used to relate $a, b,$ and $c$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the equation from Step 5\n$c = \\frac{a + b + 3c + 4}{5} + 2$. Multiplying both sides by 5 gives $5c = a + b + 3c + 4 + 10$. Simplifying further, $5c = a + b + 3c + 14$, which simplifies to $2c = a + b + 14$.\n\n## Step 7: Minimize the mode by minimizing $c$\nTo minimize the mode ($c + 2$), we need to minimize $c$. Since $a, b, c$ are positive integers and $a \\leq b \\leq c$, we need to find the smallest $c$ that satisfies $2c = a + b + 14$ and the condition that $c + 2$ is the mode.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the condition that $c+2$ is the mode and minimize $c$\nFor $c + 2$ to be the mode, $d = e = c + 2$. So, we have $a, b, c, c+2, c+2$. To minimize $c$, we should consider the smallest possible values for $a$ and $b$ that are less than or equal to $c$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, the smallest possible value for $a$ is $1$. To minimize $c$, we should also consider $b = c$ or $b < c$ but as close as possible to $c$ to minimize $c$.\n\n## Step 9: Test with $b = c$ to minimize $c$\nIf $b = c$, then $2c = a + c + 14$, simplifying to $c = a + 14$. Since $a \\leq b = c$, the smallest $a$ can be is $1$, making $c = 1 + 14 = 15$. So, $a = 1$, $b = c = 15$, and $d = e = 17$. This gives a valid set where $c = 15$ and the mode is $17$.\n\n## Step 10: Test with $b < c$ to see if $c$ can be minimized further\nLet's try to minimize $c$ further by making $a$ and $b$ as small as possible while $b < c$. If $a = 1$ and $b = c - 1$, substituting into $2c = a + b + 14$ gives $2c = 1 + (c - 1) + 14$. Simplifying, $2c = c + 14$, which gives $c = 14$. So, $a = 1$, $b = 13$, $c = 14$, $d = e = 16$. This is a valid scenario.\n\n## Step 11: Verify if $c = 14$ is the smallest possible $c$ that meets all conditions\nFor $c = 14$, $a = 1$, $b = 13$, the numbers are $1, 13, 14, 16, 16$. The mode is $16$, the median is $14$, and the mean is $\\frac{1 + 13 + 14 + 16 + 16}{5} = 12$. Here, $16 = 14 + 2$ and $14 = 12 + 2$, so all conditions are met.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$",
            "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nThe problem states that Camila writes down five positive integers. We are given that the unique mode of these integers is $2$ greater than their median, and the median is $2$ greater than their arithmetic mean. We need to find the least possible value for the mode.\n\n## Step 2: Define the terms and establish the relationships between them\nLet's denote the five integers as $a, b, c, d, e$ in ascending order. The median is $c$, the mode is the value that appears most frequently, and the arithmetic mean is $\\frac{a + b + c + d + e}{5}$. We know that the mode is $c + 2$ and the median $c$ is $2$ greater than the mean.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the given conditions to the integers\nSince the mode is unique and is $c + 2$, it means that $d = e = c + 2$ because the mode must appear more than once. So, our numbers are $a, b, c, c+2, c+2$.\n\n## Step 4: Express the median and the mean using $c$\nThe median is $c$. The mean is $\\frac{a + b + c + (c + 2) + (c + 2)}{5} = \\frac{a + b + 3c + 4}{5}$.\n\n## Step 5: Use the given relationship between the median and the mean\nWe are given that $c = \\frac{a + b + 3c + 4}{5} + 2$. Simplifying this gives $c = \\frac{a + b + 3c + 4 + 10}{5}$, which further simplifies to $5c = a + b + 3c + 14$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the equation to find the relationship between $a, b,$ and $c$\nSimplifying the equation from Step 5, we get $5c - 3c = a + b + 14$, which simplifies to $2c = a + b + 14$. Therefore, $a + b = 2c - 14$.\n\n## Step 7: Minimize the mode by choosing appropriate values for $a, b,$ and $c$\nTo minimize the mode ($c + 2$), we need to minimize $c$. Since $a, b, c$ are positive integers and $a \\leq b \\leq c$, we need to ensure that $a$ and $b$ are as small as possible while still satisfying $a + b = 2c - 14$ and the condition that $c$ is the median.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the condition that $a, b, c$ are positive integers and $a \\leq b \\leq c$\nTo minimize $c$, we should consider the smallest possible values for $a$ and $b$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, the smallest value for $a$ is $1$. To minimize $b$, we should set $b = a$ or as close as possible to $a$ while ensuring $b \\leq c$.\n\n## Step 9: Find the minimum $c$ that satisfies all conditions\nLet's set $a = b = 1$ to minimize $a + b$, giving $1 + 1 = 2c - 14$, which simplifies to $2 = 2c - 14$. Solving for $c$, we get $2c = 16$, so $c = 8$. We need to check if this satisfies the condition that $a \\leq b \\leq c$, which it does.\n\n## Step 10: Verify if $c = 8$ is a valid solution\nFor $c = 8$, $a + b = 2$ when $a = b = 1$. The numbers are $1, 1, 8, 10, 10$. Here, the mode is $10$, the median is $8$, and the mean is $\\frac{1 + 1 + 8 + 10 + 10}{5} = 6$. Checking the conditions: the mode ($10$) is $2$ greater than the median ($8$), and the median ($8$) is $2$ greater than the mean ($6$), so $c = 8$ is a valid solution.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the mode\nThe mode is $c + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"

            "## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the task\nThe given equation is $y^4+1=x^4+2y^2$. The task is to identify the graph of this equation in the coordinate plane.\n\n## Step 2: Manipulate the equation to a more recognizable form\nRearrange the equation to get everything on one side: $y^4 - 2y^2 + 1 = x^4$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the left side of the equation\nNotice that the left side resembles a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as $(y^2 - 1)^2 = x^4$.\n\n## Step 4: Further simplify the equation\nTaking the square root of both sides gives $|y^2 - 1| = |x^2|$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the absolute value equation\nThis results in two cases: $y^2 - 1 = x^2$ and $y^2 - 1 = -x^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the first case\nFor $y^2 - 1 = x^2$, rearranging gives $y^2 - x^2 = 1$. This is the equation of a hyperbola centered at the origin with its transverse axis along the y-axis.\n\n## Step 7: Solve the second case\nFor $y^2 - 1 = -x^2$, rearranging gives $y^2 + x^2 = 1$. This is the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius 1.\n\n## Step 8: Combine the results of both cases\nThe graph of the given equation consists of the graphs of $y^2 - x^2 = 1$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.\n\n## Step 9: Describe the graphs\n$y^2 - x^2 = 1$ represents a hyperbola with vertices at $(0, \\pm1)$, and $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ represents a circle with radius 1.\n\n## Step 10: Consider the intersection points\nTo see if these graphs intersect, we need to solve them simultaneously. Substituting $x^2 = 1 - y^2$ from the circle's equation into the hyperbola's equation yields $y^2 - (1 - y^2) = 1$, simplifying to $2y^2 = 2$, hence $y^2 = 1$. This gives $y = \\pm1$. When $y = \\pm1$, $x = 0$. So, they intersect at $(0, 1)$ and $(0, -1)$.\n\n## Step 11: Determine the final graph\nThe graph consists of a hyperbola and a circle that intersect at $(0,1)$ and $(0,-1)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{y^2 - x^2 = 1 \\text{ and } x^2 + y^2 = 1}$",
            "## Step 1: Understand the given equation\nThe equation given is $y^4+1=x^4+2y^2$. We need to simplify and understand this equation to determine its graph.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the equation\nRearrange the equation to get everything on one side: $y^4 - 2y^2 + 1 = x^4$.\n\n## Step 3: Recognize a perfect square trinomial\nNotice that $y^4 - 2y^2 + 1$ is a perfect square trinomial because it follows the pattern $a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2$, where $a = y^2$ and $b = 1$. So, $y^4 - 2y^2 + 1 = (y^2 - 1)^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Rewrite the equation with the perfect square\nSubstitute the perfect square back into the equation: $(y^2 - 1)^2 = x^4$.\n\n## Step 5: Take the square root of both sides\nTaking the square root of both sides gives $y^2 - 1 = \\pm x^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Split into two separate equations\nThis results in two equations: $y^2 - 1 = x^2$ and $y^2 - 1 = -x^2$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the first equation\nFor $y^2 - 1 = x^2$, rearranging gives $y^2 - x^2 = 1$, which is the equation of a hyperbola.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the second equation\nFor $y^2 - 1 = -x^2$, rearranging gives $y^2 + x^2 = 1$, which is the equation of a circle with radius 1.\n\n## Step 9: Combine the results\nThe original equation represents the combination of a hyperbola ($y^2 - x^2 = 1$) and a circle ($x^2 + y^2 = 1$).\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the hyperbola and circle equations\nThe hyperbola $y^2 - x^2 = 1$ has its vertices at $(0, \\pm1)$ and opens upwards and downwards. The circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ is centered at the origin with a radius of 1.\n\n## Step 11: Determine the intersection points\nTo see if they intersect, we solve the system of equations. Substituting $x^2 = y^2 - 1$ from the hyperbola into $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ gives $y^2 - 1 + y^2 = 1$, simplifying to $2y^2 = 2$, hence $y^2 = 1$. This means $y = \\pm1$, and substituting $y = \\pm1$ into $y^2 - x^2 = 1$ gives $1 - x^2 = 1$, leading to $x^2 = 0$, so $x = 0$. Thus, the points of intersection are $(0, 1)$ and $(0, -1)$.\n\n## Step 12: Conclusion on the graph\nSince both the hyperbola and the circle pass through $(0, \\pm1)$, and these are the only points where they intersect, the graph of the given equation consists of these two curves.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{y^2 - x^2 = 1 \\text{ and } x^2 + y^2 = 1}$"
